3. My definition of Big Data:

Big Data refers to a huge enormous amount of data. How big is Big Data? There’s no concrete scale for it. Now we talk about petabytes or exabytes scales but soon enough these scales would become not too big any more. The reason is that data is produced continuously and is said to double the size in every two years. Big data is available in real time and is produced in more complicated forms and formats, such as text, videos, photos, audios, etc. It is not easy to process Big Data with traditional software such as Excel, Access and SQL, which are often used for structured data. This requires humans to learn and use advanced techniques and technology such as machine learning and programming to deal with unstructured data and other complicatedness of Big Data. In Big Data there are four basic V characteristics: volume (how big), variety (what types), velocity (how fast), and veracity (how truthful). These are all important in determining how helpful and efficient Big Data is in working to serve people from various sectors and industries. One of the Big Data’s missions is to help improve decision making process by providing insights into current activities of  companies and organizations. For example, by using Big Data (such as collecting and analyzing customers’ reviews and comments), companies can understand more accurately about customers’ demands and shopping behaviors and thereby improve their current products and produce new products to meet the market demand.
